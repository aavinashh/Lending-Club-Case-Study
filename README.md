## General Information

Business Understanding 

When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.

**There are two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:**

> * If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
> * If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

The data given contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

When a person applies for a loan, there are two types of decisions that could be taken by the company:

> **Loan accepted:** If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:
> * **Fully paid**: Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate)
> * **Current**: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet completed. These candidates are not labelled as 'defaulted'.
> * **Charged-off**: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan 
>
> **Loan rejected:** Not Considered as there is no transactional history of those applicants with the company and so this data is not available with the company
