The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.\n\nWhen a person applies for a loan, there are two types of decisions that could be taken by the company:\n\n> **Loan accepted:** If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:\n> * **Fully paid**: Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate)\n> * **Current**: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet completed. These candidates are not labelled as 'defaulted'.\n> * **Charged-off**: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan \n>\n> **Loan rejected:** Not Considered as there is no transactional history of those applicants with the company and so this data is not available with the company\n\n","metadata":{"id":"8pjUUkUQfDsS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Import and Cleanup","metadata":{"id":"pr7HBy9efdyp"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":" **Importing
